1. Added the tex file. Please check if your names are ok in there
2. Start writing the report in the Tex file. The sections indicate where each problem is.
3. Add any source code (planner files, PDDL etc.,) into the src folder. You can create any folder structure
inside the src folder, but make sure the files at the root are only the tex files for the report.
